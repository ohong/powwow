    Session Title: Building Applications with AI Agents
    Description:
    Generative AI has dramatically shortened the distance between ideas and implementation, enabling faster prototyping and deployment than ever before. But while language models can streamline individual tasks, true transformation comes from combining these capabilities into intelligent, autonomous systems—AI agents.
    
    This talk explores how to build and deploy foundation model-enabled agent systems that go beyond simple prompt chaining or chatbots. Drawing from real-world implementations and the latest research, it offers a clear and practical path to designing both single-agent and multi-agent systems capable of handling complex workflows with minimal oversight.
    
    Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the core design principles behind agentic systems, the architectural trade-offs involved in orchestrating multiple agents, and the strategies required to develop tailored solutions that enhance efficiency and innovation. Whether just beginning or scaling up, participants will leave with actionable insights to navigate the rapidly evolving world of AI autonomy.

    Session Title: AX is the only Experience that Matters
    Description:
    If you’re building devtools for humans, you’re building for the past.
    
    Already a quarter of Y Combinator’s latest batch used AI to write 95% or more of their code. AI agents are scaling at an exponential rate and soon, they’ll outnumber human developers by orders of magnitude.
    
    
    The real bottleneck isn’t intelligence. It’s tooling. Terminals, local machines, and dashboards weren’t built for agents. They make do… until they can’t.
    
    In this talk, I’ll share how we killed the CLI at Daytona, rebuilt our infrastructure from first principles, and what it takes to build devtools that agents can actually use. Because in an agent-native future, if agents can’t use your tool, no one will.

    Session Title: The 4 Patterns of AI Native Development
    Description:
    AI is fundamentally reshaping software development roles and activities. While the change is obvious, understanding the actual shifts taking place on the individual developer remains challenging.
    
    In this talk, we introduce the four AI Native Dev patterns that are currently emerging:
    - From producer to manager: we say what AI needs to do
    - From implementation to intent: we care less on the how but focus on the why
    - From delivery to discovery: we experiment and learn
    - From content creation to knowledge: capture knowhow to get better
    
    We backup these patterns by showcasing features in tools that support these shift.
    
    The aim of the patterns is to help grasp how to position you and your team members 's career effectively in this changing landscape.

    Session Title: Benchmarks Are Memes: How What We Measure Shapes AI—and Us
    Description:
    Benchmarks shape more than just AI models—they shape our future. The things we choose to measure become self-fulfilling prophecies, guiding AI toward specific abilities and, ultimately, defining humanity’s evolving role in the AI era. Today’s benchmarks have propelled incredible progress, but now we have an exciting opportunity: thoughtfully designing benchmarks around what genuinely matters to us—cooperation, creativity, education, and meaningful human experiences.
    
    In this talk, we’ll explore how benchmarks function as powerful cultural memes, influencing not only technical outcomes but societal direction. Drawing on practical examples we have seen at Every consulting in industries like finance, journalism, education, and even personally making AI play diplomacy. We’ll uncover what makes a benchmark impactful, approachable, and inspiring. You’ll see our engaging new AI Diplomacy benchmark demo, illustrating vividly how thoughtful evaluation design can excite both engineers and the wider community.
    
    You’ll hopefully walk away inspired and equipped to define benchmarks intentionally, helping steer AI toward outcomes that truly matter.

    Session Title: Monetizing AI: From Zero to Profit
    Description:
    As AI continues to transform industries, companies are faced with the critical challenge of effectively monetizing AI-driven products in a way that captures value, ensures customer adoption, and scales revenue sustainably. Unlike traditional SaaS models, AI-powered products have unique complexities - such as fluctuating usage patterns, variable compute costs, and evolving customer demands, making conventional pricing strategies unhelpful to the growth of an AI product-led startup.
    
    In this session, Alvaro Morales, CEO and co-founder of Orb, will explore why the often overlooked monetization aspect of AI is critical for businesses. He’ll share real-world examples and data to demonstrate how adaptive pricing models can drive cost savings, enhance customer experience, and reduce operational bottlenecks.
    
    Alvaro will lead a live demo, showcasing how engineers can simulate AI pricing strategies and subsequently integrate them with a simple plug-and-play solution. He’ll also share how real-world revenue simulations enable companies to test and refine pricing before implementing — reducing risk, boosting adoption, and unlocking new revenue streams. As a quick example, cloud software development platform Replit was looking to adopt a usage-based pricing model for a new product, but their existing billing system couldn't support the new model, and building a new billing system would delay the launch timeline. In order to get things done, they turned to Orb, which enabled them to make pricing changes up to the last minute. After the launch, Orb became the single source of truth for both Replit and its customers - providing usage alerts to notify Replit when users hit cost thresholds and provide insights into user spend and payment methods.
    
    Key takeaways:
    The challenge of AI monetization – Why traditional subscription-based SaaS pricing models don’t work for AI-powered products.
    Precision pricing – Exploring how usage-based, tiered, and hybrid pricing models can maximize revenue potential.
    Revenue simulation for AI pricing – Leveraging real-time data to test, adjust and optimize pricing strategies.
    Avoiding common pricing pitfalls – Identifying mistakes that can lead to revenue leakage and customer churn.
    
    This session is designed for AI executives, product leaders, and engineering teams looking for actionable strategies to build adaptive, scalable pricing models that drive long-term growth and profitability.

    Description:
    AI agents are changing the way modern SaaS products operate. Whether automating workflows, integrating with APIs, or acting on behalf of users, AI-driven assistants and autonomous systems are becoming core product features. But securing these agents presents a fundamental challenge: How do you authenticate AI agents? How do you control what they can access? How do you ensure they act within the right permissions?

    Session Title: Shipping Products When You Don’t Know What they Can Do
    Description:
    A customer recently asked me: “Hey, can I tag your AI agent in a Google Doc comment?”
    
    The honest answer: I have no idea! We never designed our agents to handle Google Doc comments, but we tried it anyway… and it worked! The agent performed beautifully, the customer was thrilled, and I was left bewildered.
    
    Welcome to Product Management for AI agents, where roadmaps are fuzzy and we only learn the boundaries of our products after they’re released. When a product doesn’t follow predefined requirements but instead learns and improvises at runtime, PMs must give up control and lean into uncertainty, curiosity, experimentation, and fast feedback loops.
    
    This talk is a field guide for Product/Engineering teams navigating this new reality. We’ll cover how to write specs for affordances instead of features, how to use AI evals as a product development tool, and how to perform User Acceptance Testing on undocumented emergent behavior. Most importantly, we’ll explore how to build trust with customers even when the answer is, truthfully, “I don’t know.”
    
    If you’re managing AI-native products in 2025 the same way you managed web apps in 2020, you might find yourself A/B testing an agent that decided to go off and do C, D, and E all by themselves!

    Session Title: Prompt Engineering is Dead - Everything is a Spec
    Description:
    [!!Subject to change!!]
    
    Large models are trained through mountains of data and learned reward functions, yet - quis custodiet ipsos custodes? - what exactly are those amorphous blobs of data and rewards trying to specify? Building LLMs in any domain demands both clarity of thought and the skill to communicate those thoughts precisely - not only to other humans but to the models themselves. Without either, we risk unpleasant surprises.
    
    This talk dives into:
    •	Why prompt spaghetti and data gumbo inevitably collapse at scale, unleashing behaviors we never intended - while a rigorously versioned spec keeps safety, personality, and UX firmly aligned, and makes incidents easier and faster to diagnose and fix.
    •	How OpenAI’s public Model Spec provides a clear template, complemented by emerging “dev tools” that turn hazy human intent into precise, human-and-machine-readable policy.
    •	How deliberative alignment training teaches models to first read and reason about the spec, boosting robustness without inflating context windows.
    •	Practical tactics for catching ambiguity, untangling contradictions, and preserving global consistency. Plus, techniques for verifying that deployed models truly follow the contract we crafted.

    Description:
    We’re all hearing that AI agents will enable AGI, but they can’t yet reliably perform even basic computer tasks. It turns out that getting AI to click, type, and scroll is more challenging than getting it to generate code. How can we build general-purpose agents that can do anything we can do on a computer?
    
    This is our goal at the Amazon AGI SF Lab. In this talk, I’ll propose a new approach to agents that we call Useful General Intelligence. After describing how we’re solving the biggest challenges in computer use while enabling developers to access our tech in it’s earliest developmental stages, I’ll show real workflows that developers have built with Nova Act, our agentic model and SDK.

    Description:
    AI agents are calling APIs, submitting forms, and sending emails—but how do you control what they’re allowed to do? As agents act on behalf of users or organizations, traditional patterns like OAuth, session tokens, and role-based access often fall short.
    In this talk, we’ll explore how machine identity is evolving to meet this new landscape. You’ll learn:
    
    - How to think about authentication for agents (not just humans)
    - What it means to authorize an action when the actor is an LLM or headless service
    - Real-world strategies from WorkOS and Cloudflare for assigning, managing, and revoking agent identity and access
    
    By the end, you’ll walk away with practical tools and mental models to build agent-powered systems that are secure, auditable, and scalable.

    Session Title: How LLMs work for Web Devs: GPT in 600 lines of Vanilla JS
    Description:
    Don't be intimidated. Modern AI can feel like magic, but underneath the hood are principles that web developers can understand, even if you don't have a machine learning background. In this workshop, we'll explore a complete GPT-2 inference implementation built entirely in Vanilla JS. This JavaScript translation of the popular "Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need" approach will let you debug and step through a real LLM line by line without the overhead of learning a new language, framework, or even IDE.
    
    All the major LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Llama, inherit from GPT-2's architecture, making this exploration a solid foundation to understand modern AI systems and comprehend the latest research.
    
    While we won't have time to cover *everything*, you'll gain the essential knowledge to understand the key concepts that matter when building with LLMs, including how they:
    
    -Convert raw text into meaningful tokens
    - Represent semantic meaning through vector embeddings
    - Train neural networks through gradient descent
    - Generate text with sampling algorithms like top-k, top-p, and temperature
    
    This intense but beginner-friendly workshop is designed specifically for web developers diving into ML and AI for the first time. It’s your "missing AI degree" in just two hours. You'll walk away with an intuitive mental model of how Transformers work that you can apply immediately to your own LLM-powered projects.

    Description:
    We've all seen website chat bots which can look up an order or answer a basic question -- but what does it take to build autonomous agents which manage long, delicate processes like multi-day medical treatments?
    
    In this workshop, we'll explore a workflow Stride built in partnership with Avila (https://avilascience.com/) that helps patients self-administer medication regimens at home.  The stack includes LangGraph/LangSmith, Claude, MCP, Node.js, React, MongoDB, and Twilio, and rests on a foundation of treatment "blueprints" which LLM-powered agents use to guide patients to good outcomes.
    
    You'll learn how to:
    -Build a hybrid system of code and prompts that leverages LLM decisioning to drive a web application, message queue and database
    -Design and maintain flexible agentic workflow blueprints, with no special tools (just Google Docs!)
    -Create an agent evaluation system, which uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the complexity of each interaction and escalate to human support when needed
    
    We'll also talk about the prompt engineered guidelines and guardrails which helps agents adhere to protocol as much as possible, while gracefully handling curveballs from the patient.  Please bring questions -- we look forward to sharing our learnings on how to make agentic systems like this work in the real world!

    Session Title: Why Your Agent’s Brain Needs a Playbook: Practical Wins from Using Ontologies
    Description:
    You're trying to guide how your agents think and act. Code-orchestrated workflows are too rigid, but LLMs charting their own course feel too chaotic. When you need a middle ground, it’s time to reach for the secret weapon: ontologies. These graph-shaped fragments of actionable knowledge can fill in critical gaps.
    
    In this talk, we’ll explore together how ontologies bring structure, semantics, and sanity to GenAI-powered applications. You’ll learn when they’re useful, how to apply them, and what kinds of problems they help solve. Through practical examples, we’ll show how ontologies (1) guide knowledge graph construction, (2) add a semantic layer for more efficient and accurate retrieval (GraphRAG), and (3) encode domain logic you don’t want to leave up to the LLM.

    Give them tools & tokens and everything changes: what we use them for, how we use them, how many we run at the same time, how they talk to each other, how they talk to you, what they even are...
    
    It's all going to change.

    Session Title: How to trust an agent with software delivery
    Description:
    AI-powered agents promise faster, easier software delivery, but their unpredictable behavior often makes engineers hesitant to fully trust them with critical workflows. Sam Alba, Co-founder of Dagger (and previously co-creator of Docker), explains how teams can reliably integrate agents into their delivery pipelines by shifting how they structure and manage automation.
    
    He'll share four practical strategies learned from real-world experience:
    
    1. Treat agents as workflow participants, not isolated tools.
    Stop using agents as disconnected scripts or IDE plugins. Treating them as first-class parts of your delivery process simplifies your architecture, reduces hidden complexity, and makes agent outcomes more predictable.
    
    2. Use many small agents instead of one big one.
    Just as software evolved from monoliths to microservices, software delivery benefits from smaller, specialized agents with clearly defined responsibilities. Smaller agents are easier to understand, maintain, and integrate.
    
    3. Define clear environments—the real lever for reliability.
    Instead of chasing perfect prompts or models, focus on clearly defining the tools, resources, and permissions around your agents. Precisely controlling their environments makes agents behave consistently and reliably.
    
    4. Design workflows for easy debugging and observability.
    Agents will sometimes fail unexpectedly. Sam will share simple, effective ways to build clear tracing and observability into your workflows from the start, making debugging quicker and less frustrating.
    
    You'll leave with practical, immediately usable techniques that give you the confidence to trust AI agents in your software delivery pipelines.

    Description:
    If software was eating the world before, knowledge work will soon be devoured by AI. In corporate America there are thousands of hours spent on rote tasks every day by employees, consultants, and lawyers alike. But is AI really capable of replacing work in the real world yet?
    Productivity estimates from GenAI range from 1.5% (NBER) to 96% (☝ us! ️). In this talk we'll share war stories of where the answer is yes (and no) and how we reduced human time spent on tasks from days to minutes in high-impact situations.
    The path from promise to actual product, used in real world settings, from our experience, is still unmapped. Learn what we built, how we built it - with code - and how we got stakeholder buy-in to deploy it.

    Description:
    AI agents are on the cusp of revolutionizing work as we know it. The number of use cases software can tackle is set to explode as AI handles tasks requiring real judgment. But to cross the gap between an interesting AI prototype and an essential business tool, you need agents built by developers with real guardrails and security.
    
    This means blending AI assistance with traditional coding in a multimodal approach that maximizes efficiency and control. The future isn't about dropping in an LLM — it requires integrating any model, any data, any system to deliver results.
    
    Companies utilizing this approach can finally turn their slice of the $500B+ of total AI investment into real business results.

    Description:
    We will review the different kinds of automation use-cases, and the approach we used, that will drive over a $100M of expected annual impact by deploying AI for business critical initiatives.
    
    We will discuss what kinds of automation initiatives become possible because of Gen AI. These were not tenable before because of the amount of customization required per customer or per scenario, and the kind of data involved in these workflows. Previously, these workflows were driven manually which were both error prone and required expensive training.
    
    To replace or augment these manual business critical processes, automation _has_ to cross a very high bar of reliability.
    
    We will share how we addressed the inherent non-determinism of Gen AI to create a predictable system that doesn’t have any surprising failure modes. We’ll also discuss how we worked with our existing data that was spread across various systems without an expensive centralisation and clean up effort.

    Session Title: "Data readiness" is a myth: Make AI Reliabile with an Agentic Semantic Layer
    Description:
    The rapid progress in LLM capability has not translated to increased reliability for business critical AI use cases. The root-cause? Data is "not ready".
    Conversational analytics doesn't go beyond the analyst team because it's hard to verify if the generated queries are actually doing what they are supposed to.
    RAG based systems often fail to handle the breadth and depth of real world use-cases because it requires a prohibitive amount of preparation & maintenance of an underlying knowledge graph.
    
    Agentic AI systems need to hard-code specific workflows to work reliably and end up looking more like software engineering with LLM calls instead of delivering on the promise of truly agentic workflows.
    
    In all of these failure modes, the common culprit is that the planning or reasoning done by the LLM fails to accurately capture the user's intent or the domain's context aka the lack of a well prepared semantic data layer.
    
    Enterprise data is silo-ed and vastly varying levels of quality and the perfect "semantic layer" and "metadata" is a moving target. New data is continuously being created and business definitions are rapidly changing and often entirely on-demand.
    In this talk we'll share how you can build and maintain a semantic data layer that is maintained entirely by AI, and show (with live examples) how that dramatically improves reliability of the AI system that needs dynamic access to data.
    We'll demonstrate how this sufficiently augments existing RAG, text-to-SQL and tool calling techniques and starts opening the door to reliable AI deployments.

    Description:
    Hi, I'm Dex. I've been hacking on AI agents for a while.
    
    I've tried every agent framework out there, from the plug-and-play crew/langchains to the "minimalist" smolagents of the world to the "production grade" langraph, griptape, etc.
    
    I've talked to a lot of really strong founders who are all building really impressive things with AI. Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don't see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.
    
    I've been surprised to find that most of the products out there billing themselves as "AI Agents" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.
    
    Agents, at least the good ones, don't follow the "here's your prompt, here's a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal" pattern. Rather, they are comprised of mostly just software.
    
    So, I set out to answer:
    
    What are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?

    Description:
    Cursor, v0, chai.new, lovable, bolt — what do they all have in common? They weren’t built on AI frameworks—they're built using primitives optimized for speed, scale, and flexibility.
    
    LLMs are evolving fast—like, literally every week. New standards pop up (looking at you, MCP), and APIs change faster than you can keep track. Frameworks just can't move at this speed.
    
    In this talk, I'll challenge conventional engineering wisdom, sharing my real-world experience scaling thousands of AI agents to handle over 100 million monthly runs.
    
    You'll discover how using AI primitives can dramatically speed up iteration, provide bigger scale, and simplify maintenance.
    
    I'll share eight practical agent architectures—covering memory management, auto tool integration, and simple serverless deployment—to help you quickly build reliable and scalable AI agents.
    
    By the end of this session, you'll clearly see why we must rethink and rebuild our infrastructure and focus on AI-native primitives instead of heavy, bloated, and quickly outdated frameworks.
    
    I wonder if we need another S3-moment but for the AI agent infrastructure.

    Session Title: Architecting Agent Memory: Principles, Patterns, and Best Practices
    Description:
    In the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic systems, memory management has emerged as a key pillar for building intelligent, context-aware AI Agents. Inspired by the complexity of human memory systems—such as episodic, working, semantic, and procedural memory—this talk unpacks how AI agents can achieve believability, reliability, and capability by retaining and reasoning over past experiences.
    We’ll begin by establishing a conceptual framework based on real-world implementations from memory management libraries and system architectures:
    Memory Components representing various structured memory types (e.g., conversation, workflow, episodic, persona)
    Memory Modes reflecting operational strategies for short-term, long-term, and dynamic memory handling
    Next, the talk transitions to practical implementation patterns critical for effective memory lifecycle management:
    Maintaining rich conversation history and contextual awareness
    Persistence strategies leveraging vector databases and hybrid search
    Memory augmentation using embeddings, relevance scoring, and semantic retrieval
    Production-ready practices for scaling memory in multi-agent ecosystems
    We’ll also examine advanced memory strategies within agentic systems:
    Memory cascading and selective deletion
    Integration of tool use and persona memory
    Optimizing performance around memory retrieval and LLM context window limits
    Whether you're developing autonomous agents, chatbots, or complex workflow orchestration systems, this talk offers knowledge and tactical insights for building AI that can remember, adapt, and improve over time.
    This session is ideal for:
    AI engineers and agent framework developers
    Architects designing Agentic RAG or multi-agent systems
    Practitioners building contextual, personalized AI experiences
    By the end of the session, you’ll understand how to leverage memory as a strategic asset in agentic design—and walk away ready to build agents that not only act and reason but also remember.

    Session Title: How to trust an agent with software delivery
    Description:
    AI-powered agents promise faster, easier software delivery, but their unpredictable behavior often makes engineers hesitant to fully trust them with critical workflows. Sam Alba, Co-founder of Dagger (and previously co-creator of Docker), explains how teams can reliably integrate agents into their delivery pipelines by shifting how they structure and manage automation.
    
    He'll share four practical strategies learned from real-world experience:
    
    1. Treat agents as workflow participants, not isolated tools.
    Stop using agents as disconnected scripts or IDE plugins. Treating them as first-class parts of your delivery process simplifies your architecture, reduces hidden complexity, and makes agent outcomes more predictable.
    
    2. Use many small agents instead of one big one.
    Just as software evolved from monoliths to microservices, software delivery benefits from smaller, specialized agents with clearly defined responsibilities. Smaller agents are easier to understand, maintain, and integrate.
    
    3. Define clear environments—the real lever for reliability.
    Instead of chasing perfect prompts or models, focus on clearly defining the tools, resources, and permissions around your agents. Precisely controlling their environments makes agents behave consistently and reliably.
    
    4. Design workflows for easy debugging and observability.
    Agents will sometimes fail unexpectedly. Sam will share simple, effective ways to build clear tracing and observability into your workflows from the start, making debugging quicker and less frustrating.
    
    You'll leave with practical, immediately usable techniques that give you the confidence to trust AI agents in your software delivery pipelines.

    Session Title: Agents vs Workflows: Why Not Both?
    Description:
    One current hot debate is should you make your top-level abstraction a ReAct type agent running in a loop? or should you make it a structured workflow graph?
    
    OpenAI is launching their new framework and throwing shade on workflow graph approaches
    
    TBH we think this whole debate is kinda dumb.
    
    We've seen a lot of folks be able to structure the problem in a way that a workflow graph makes a lot of sense.
    
    We also see a ton of agents where you need to run the core bit in a loop for a long time.
    
    You can also give your agents structured workflow graphs as a tool. You can use structured workflow graphs as a handoff mechanism between agents. What we've seen from the community is frankly that folks need to tinker with multiple approaches and combine primitives in interesting ways
    
    We'll share a couple stories where teams ended up with workflow graph based approaches, a couple where teams ended up with agent based approaches, and a couple where a blended approach made sense.

    Session Title: Real-time Experiments with an AI Co-Scientist
    Description:
    The sheer volume of data and complexity of modern scientific challenges necessitate tools that go beyond mere analysis. The vision of an "AI Co-scientist" – a true collaborative partner in the lab – requires sophisticated engineering to bridge the gap between powerful AI reasoning and the dynamic reality of physical experiments. This talk dives into the engineering required to build robust AI Co-scientists for hands-on research. We will explore scalable architectures, such as multi-agent systems leveraging foundation models like Gemini for complex reasoning, hypothesis refinement (inspired by the "generate, debate, evolve" paradigm described in recent AI Co-scientist research), and intelligent tool use. The core focus will be on the engineering challenges and solutions for integrating diverse, real-time empirical data streams – visual data from cameras, quantitative readings from sensors, positional feedback from actuators, and instrument outputs – directly into the AI's reasoning loop. I will illustrate this with concrete, technically detailed examples in chemistry (adaptive reaction monitoring), robotics (vision-guided assembly with SO Arm 100 and LeRobot library), and synthetic biology (real-time bacterial growth monitoring & interpretation). We'll discuss engineering strategies for handling data heterogeneity, latency, noise, and enabling the AI to interpret, correlate, and act upon live experimental feedback. Finally, we will touch upon how thoughtful engineering of these AI Co-scientists can contribute to democratizing access to advanced scientific capabilities.

    Description:
    Are conversational interfaces the future or, as many designers have suggested, a lazy solution that is bottlenecking AI-HCI? Despite well-documented usability issues, the design of many AI applications defaults to an input field, turn-by-turn flow, and an endless model picker — I call this “The Bitter Layout”.
    
    In this talk, we’ll explore how Clay Christensen’s theory of commoditization from the early PC industry can explain why scaling laws require AI interfaces to remain modular until models fully commoditize. The killer feature of conversational interfaces may not be that they’re natural, but that they’re conformable. Learn how to evolve interfaces as inference scales, spot shifts in the basis of competition, and stop worrying about the next model update steamrolling your design decisions.

    Description:
    Autonomous or semi-autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) involve exponentially complex configurations (system config, agent configs, task management and delegation, etc.). These present unique interface design challenges for both developer tooling and end-user experiences.
    In this session, I'll explore UX design principles for multi-agent systems, addressing critical questions: What is the true configuration space for autonomous MAS? How can users arrive at the correct mental model of an MAS's capabilities, if at all? How can we improve trust and safety through techniques like cost-aware action delegation? What makes agent actions observable? How do we enable seamless interruptibility? Attendees will gain actionable insights to create more transparent, trustworthy, and user-centered multi-agent applications, illustrated through real-world implementations in AutoGen Studio - a low code developer tool built on AutoGen (44k stars on GitHub, MIT license) and similar tools.

    Description:
    One of the biggest challenges in building evals you can trust is building metrics that reliably measure goodness in your application; metrics that are highly accurate, rapid fast, and tunable to ground truth rater and user behavior. This workshop is inspired by decades of AI and machine learning development in Google Search, reinvented for the modern LLM stack by the Pi team over the past year.
    
    In this workshop you will learn how to:
    1) Brainstorm and design custom metrics tailored to your specific application needs.
    2) Identify which types of signals (natural language, code, other models) work best for your use case through rapid trial and error.
    3) Combine & calibrate your metrics against ground truth data using real examples from your domain.
    4) Use simple tools like Google Sheets for visualizing and analyzing your inputs and outputs with those metrics.
    5) Integrate your scoring models into both online workflows like agent control and offline ones like model comparison and training evaluation.

    Session Title: CI in the Era of AI: From Unit Tests to Stochastic Evals
    Description:
    Software engineers have long understood that high-quality code requires comprehensive automated testing. For decades, our industry has relied on deterministic tests with clear pass/fail outcomes to ensure reliability.
    
    High-quality software depends on automated testing. That's certainly true at Zed, where we're building a next-generation native IDE in Rust. Zed runs at 120 frames per second, but it would also crash once a second if we didn't maintain and run a comprehensive suite of unit tests on every change.
    
    But what happens when AI enters the equation?
    
    In this talk, we'll explore how continuous integration evolves when working with AI components. "Evals" - parlance from the machine learning field - are fundamentally a continuation of the software testing tradition, but with a critical difference: they're inherently stochastic.
    
    Zed's traditional CI goes to extreme lengths to eliminate non-determinism, as nobody likes having their pull requests blocked by flaky builds. We've even fully simulated network interactions with a deterministic random scheduler. AI components, however, forced us to confront a fundamental paradigm shift—uncertainty isn't a bug but an intrinsic feature of these systems, compelling us to embrace what we couldn't avoid.
    
    We'll share our journey of reconceptualizing evals as "stochastic unit tests" - still verifying system behavior, but without binary pass/fail grades.
    
    We'll discuss practical approaches to:
    - Thoughtfully building test suites for AI components
    - Shifting from red/green outcomes to "shades of gray"
    - Replacing build gates with trend analysis and performance monitoring
    - Maintaining engineering confidence despite statistical variance
    
    Whether you're incorporating AI into existing systems or building new AI-powered tools, this talk will provide practical insights into maintaining quality when determinism gives way to probability.

    Description:
    AI is getting deployed without guardrails, without governance, without due diligence.  Surely this is the year we’ll see a Fortune 500 CEO fired because of a preventable AI incident.  Surely this is the year we’ll see enterprises wake up to pre-deployment evaluation and post-deployment monitoring being an urgent need.  This story hasn’t changed for a decade, but surely this is the year it will.
    
    In this talk, I’ll cover what enterprise-level AI/ML evaluation has looked like for the last decade - what’s changed, what hasn’t, what sells, what doesn’t, and where I see things going from here on out.  Evaluation matters - we all know this - but using my experience in the trenches over the last decade or so I hope to bridge the gap between what practitioners need and what the C-suite pays for in the space of AI evaluations.

    Description:
    Interpreting complex information from unstructured text data poses significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLM), with difficulties often arising from specialized terminology and the multifaceted relationships between entities in document architectures. Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods face limitations in capturing these nuanced interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. In our talk, we introduce a novel approach integrating Knowledge Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) with VectorRAG, designed to refine question-answering (Q&A) systems for more effective information extraction from complex texts. Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.

    Session Title: Why Your Agent’s Brain Needs a Playbook: Practical Wins from Using Ontologies
    Description:
    You're trying to guide how your agents think and act. Code-orchestrated workflows are too rigid, but LLMs charting their own course feel too chaotic. When you need a middle ground, it’s time to reach for the secret weapon: ontologies. These graph-shaped fragments of actionable knowledge can fill in critical gaps.
    
    In this talk, we’ll explore together how ontologies bring structure, semantics, and sanity to GenAI-powered applications. You’ll learn when they’re useful, how to apply them, and what kinds of problems they help solve. Through practical examples, we’ll show how ontologies (1) guide knowledge graph construction, (2) add a semantic layer for more efficient and accurate retrieval (GraphRAG), and (3) encode domain logic you don’t want to leave up to the LLM.

When our customers kept hitting this wall with their RAG systems, we knew we needed a fundamentally different approach.
    
    In this talk, I'll share Writer's journey developing a graph-based RAG architecture that achieved 86.31% accuracy on the RobustQA benchmark while maintaining sub-second response times, significantly outperforming vector approaches.
    
    I'll survey the key techniques behind this performance leap and why graph-based approaches excel with complex enterprise information structures like product documentation, financial documents, and technical specifications that challenge traditional RAG systems. You'll learn about using specialized LLMs to build semantic relationships, how compression techniques efficiently handle concentrated enterprise data patterns, and how infusing key data points in the memory layer of the LLM lowers hallucination.
    
    The presentation will provide practical insights into identifying when graph-based approaches make sense for your organization's specific data challenges, helping you make informed architectural decisions for your next enterprise RAG system.

    Session Title: Containing Agent Chaos
    Description:
    AI agents promise breakthroughs but often deliver operational chaos. Building reliable, deployable systems with unpredictable LLMs feels like wrestling fog – testing outputs alone is insufficient when the underlying workflow is opaque and flaky. How do we move beyond fragile prototypes?
    
    This talk, from the creator of Docker, argues the solution lies *outside* the model: engineering **reproducible execution workflows** built on rigorous architectural discipline. Learn how **containerization**, applied not just to deployment but to *each individual step* of an agent's workflow, provides the essential **isolation and environmental consistency** needed.
    
    Discover how combining this granular container approach with patterns like immutable state management allows us to **contain agent chaos**, unlock effective testing, simplify debugging, and bring essential control and predictability back to building powerful AI agents you can actually ship with confidence.

    Session Title: Hacking the Inference Pareto Frontier for Cheaper and Faster Tokens Without Breaking SLAs
    Description:
    Your model works! It aces the evals! It even passes the vibe check! All that’s required is inference, right? Oops, you’ve just stepped into a minefield:
    
    -Not low-latency enough? Choppy experience. Users churn from your app.
    -Not cheap enough? You’re losing money on every query.
    -Not high enough output quality? Your system can’t be used for that application.
    
    A model and the inference system around it form a “token factory” associated with a Pareto frontier— a curve representing the best possible trade-offs between cost, throughput, latency and quality, outside of which your LLM system cannot be applied successfully.
    
    Outside of the Pareto frontier? You’re back to square one.
    That is, unless you’re able to change the shape of the Pareto frontier.
    
    In this session, we’ll introduce NVIDIA Dynamo, a datacenter-scale distributed inference framework as well as the bleeding-edge techniques it enables to hack the Pareto frontier of your inference systems, including:
    
    -Disaggregation - separating phases of LLM generation to make them more efficient
    -Speculation - predicting multiple tokens per cycle
    -KV routing, storage, and manipulation - ensuring that we don’t redo work that has already been done
    -Pipelining improvements for agents - accelerating our workflows using information about the agent
    
    By the end of the talk, we’ll understand how the Pareto frontier limits where models can be applied, the intuition behind how inference techniques can be used to modify it, as well as the mechanics of how these techniques work.

    Description:
    As LLMs move into enterprise workflows, developers face a new kind of architecture challenge: how do you build reliable, interpretable systems powered by agents and reasoning?
    
    This talk unpacks how we designed and implemented an AI orchestration framework for enterprise architecture — combining LangGraph for multi-agent workflows, Flyte for distributed execution, and AWS Bedrock for LLM inference using Claude 3. The product: an AI copilot for enterprise architects, deeply rooted in your tech stack context.
    
    At the core of this system is a domain-specific **knowledge graph** that acts as long-term memory for the agents. It enables persistent, structured representations of architectural state, system dependencies, and business context — giving the agents the grounding they need to generate accurate recommendations, translate natural language into SQL or code, and maintain continuity across workflows.
    
    We’ll also cover how we’ve integrated observability practices — including planned OpenTelemetry instrumentation — to trace and debug autonomous AI systems in production.
    
    If you’re a developer or AI engineer thinking beyond the chatbot and looking to embed reasoning into complex system design and data tasks, this talk offers an end-to-end blueprint — from orchestration and grounding to production monitoring.

    Description:
    AI Agents are distributed systems. Agents need to connect and communicate with tools, data repositories, other agents, etc., all over a network. Event-Driven Architecture is a common pattern for facilitating this connectivity, using Events as the communication abstraction. However, this pattern introduces complexities as well, such as fragmented logic, increased latency, decreased observability, and more. But what if there were a way to get the benefits of Event-Driven Architecture without the complexities? Enter Durable Execution. In this talk, we'll discuss the pitfalls of Event-Driven Architecture, how Durable Execution solves these issues, and why Durable Execution, not Events, is the correct abstraction for building AI Agents.

    MCP is a solid integration layer — but how does it hold up when it comes to output quality? Often, not as well as you'd like. Here are some practical retrieval patterns, from basic to advanced, that worked well in my experiments:
    * Naive: Just plug in plain MCP and hope the LLM gets it right. Sometimes it does. Sometimes you’ll need a miracle.
    * Semantic: Add more descriptive field names and extra metadata. It helps — but usually just a bit.
    * Templated: Use a structured template and have the LLM fill it out step by step. More effort, but by far the most reliable results.

    Description:
    AI agents are changing the way modern SaaS products operate. Whether automating workflows, integrating with APIs, or acting on behalf of users, AI-driven assistants and autonomous systems are becoming core product features. But securing these agents presents a fundamental challenge: How do you authenticate AI agents? How do you control what they can access? How do you ensure they act within the right permissions? This talk will explore these concepts and more while highlighting current research and best practices.

    Session Title: The rise of the agentic economy on the shoulders of MCP
    Description:
    Thanks to MCP and all the MCP server directories, agents can now autonomously discover new tools and other agents. This lays down the foundation for the future agentic economy, where businesses will sell to autonomous agents (B2A) and eventually agents will sell to other agents (A2A).
    
    But one key part is still missing: agents do not have a standard way to subscribe to external services and pay for them.
    
    In this talk, we’ll show how to give agents full autonomy to discover and pay for new external MCP-enabled services, even if those services don’t support it, using a little-known MCP server nesting capability. We’ll also cover how to monetize AI agents and the B2A/A2A business models.

    Session Title: MCP is all you need
    Description:
    Everyone is talking about agents, and right after that, they’re talking about agent-to-agent communications. Not surprisingly, various nascent, competing protocols are popping up to handle it.
    
    But maybe all we need is MCP — the OG of GenAI communication protocols (it's from way back in 2024!).
    
    Last year, Jason Liu gave the second most watched AIE talk — “Pydantic is all you need”.
    
    This year, I (the creator of Pydantic) am continuing the tradition by arguing that MCP might be all we need for agent-to-agent communications.
    
    What I’ll cover:
    
    - Misusing Common Patterns: MCP was designed for desktop/IDE applications like Claude Code and Cursor. How can we adapt MCP for autonomous agents?
    - Many Common Problems: MCP is great, but what can go wrong? How can you work around it? Can the protocol be extended to solve these issues?
    - Monitoring Complex Phenomena: How does observability work (and not work) with MCP?
    - Multiple Competing Protocols: A quick run-through of other agent communication protocols like A2A and AGNTCY, and probably a few more by June 😴
    - Massive Crustaceans Party: What might success look like if everything goes to plan?

    Current AI models are extremely skilled, which was seen as the step change in evaluation scores across the industry in the first half of 2025, but often fail when presented with even medium time-horizon tasks. This talk presents a taxonomy of 4 traits of reasoning models -- skills, calibration, strategy, and abstraction -- that will be crucial to creating the next generation of AI applications.  With this, we focus on the latter two, strategy and abstraction, and discuss how these traits will enable long-horizon and reliable agents. The talk concludes with a scenario where these agentic behaviors are the foundation for RL continuing to scale in the coming years and post-training techniques reaching compute parity with pretraining methors sooner than later.

    Description:
    YouTube recommendations drive the majority of video watch time for billions of daily users. Traditionally powered by large embedding models (LEMs), we're undertaking a fundamental shift: rebuilding our recommendation stack using foundation models like Gemini. This talk dives into our engineering journey adapting general-purpose LLMs (Gemini) for the highly specialized, dynamic, and massive-scale task of YouTube recommendations.
    
    We'll discuss:
    - SemanticID: creating a "language" for YouTube videos, from our paper last year – Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations
    - Adapting Gemini checkpoints to understand SemanticID
    - Generative Video Retrieval with prompts
    
    There’s a lot of attention on the LLM-led transformation of Search (with AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT-Search etc). However, across large consumer apps, it’s the recommendation systems & feeds that drive most consumer engagement, not just search. This talk is about the LLM-led transformation of recommendations & feeds – building a recommendation engine on top of Gemini.

    Session Title: Evaluating AI Search: A Practical Framework for Augmented AI Systems
    Description:
    AI search is becoming the front door to information, whether through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Search-Augmented Generation (SAG), or custom agents that synthesize answers on top of indexed content. As users rely more heavily on these systems, evaluating their quality becomes mission-critical. But traditional metrics like precision and recall don’t capture the full picture.
    
    In this talk, we introduce a practical evaluation framework for AI-powered search, across three dimensions:
    - Are the retrieved sources relevant to the query?
    - And is the final answer complete?
    - Are the sources faithfully used in the generated answer?
    
    We’ll share lessons from working with search companies and present early findings from a new benchmark evaluating popular augmented AI systems across these dimensions. Rather than ranking winners and losers, we explore where different systems excel or break down, and how these tradeoffs inform product decisions.
    
    This talk is for AI engineers and product teams who want to build trusted, high-quality AI search experiences, and need a way to measure if it’s actually working.

    Session Title: Why Your Agent’s Brain Needs a Playbook: Practical Wins from Using Ontologies
    Description:
    You're trying to guide how your agents think and act. Code-orchestrated workflows are too rigid, but LLMs charting their own course feel too chaotic. When you need a middle ground, it’s time to reach for the secret weapon: ontologies. These graph-shaped fragments of actionable knowledge can fill in critical gaps.
    
    In this talk, we’ll explore together how ontologies bring structure, semantics, and sanity to GenAI-powered applications. You’ll learn when they’re useful, how to apply them, and what kinds of problems they help solve. Through practical examples, we’ll show how ontologies (1) guide knowledge graph construction, (2) add a semantic layer for more efficient and accurate retrieval (GraphRAG), and (3) encode domain logic you don’t want to leave up to the LLM.

    Description:
    Start with the simplest Search - in-memory embeddings with relevance ranking. End with the most complex planet-scale Search - 70+ corpus mix of token, embeddings, and knowledge graphs, all jointly retrieved, custom ranked, joint re-ranked, and then LLM-processed, at 160,000 queries per second in under 200msec.
    
    This talk will be a fun “one query at a time” survey of all techniques in RAG in incremental complexity, showing the limits of each technique and what the next layered one opens up in terms of capabilities to handle ever-more complex queries in RAG. You’ll learn why queries like [falafel] are notoriously hard to Search over, why chunking your documents can be disastrous, how you can sometimes can get away with a simple bm25, and how some Search problems are so hard to solve that you’re better off punting the problem to the LLM or the UX. Brought to you by the team that worked on 50+ Search products, in the context of Google.com and custom Enterprise Search.

    Session Title: Architecting Agent Memory: Principles, Patterns, and Best Practices
    Description:
    In the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic systems, memory management has emerged as a key pillar for building intelligent, context-aware AI Agents. Inspired by the complexity of human memory systems—such as episodic, working, semantic, and procedural memory—this talk unpacks how AI agents can achieve believability, reliability, and capability by retaining and reasoning over past experiences.
    We’ll begin by establishing a conceptual framework based on real-world implementations from memory management libraries and system architectures:
    Memory Components representing various structured memory types (e.g., conversation, workflow, episodic, persona)
    Memory Modes reflecting operational strategies for short-term, long-term, and dynamic memory handling
    Next, the talk transitions to practical implementation patterns critical for effective memory lifecycle management:
    Maintaining rich conversation history and contextual awareness
    Persistence strategies leveraging vector databases and hybrid search
    Memory augmentation using embeddings, relevance scoring, and semantic retrieval
    Production-ready practices for scaling memory in multi-agent ecosystems
    We’ll also examine advanced memory strategies within agentic systems:
    Memory cascading and selective deletion
    Integration of tool use and persona memory
    Optimizing performance around memory retrieval and LLM context window limits
    Whether you're developing autonomous agents, chatbots, or complex workflow orchestration systems, this talk offers knowledge and tactical insights for building AI that can remember, adapt, and improve over time.
    This session is ideal for:
    AI engineers and agent framework developers
    Architects designing Agentic RAG or multi-agent systems
    Practitioners building contextual, personalized AI experiences
    By the end of the session, you’ll understand how to leverage memory as a strategic asset in agentic design—and walk away ready to build agents that not only act and reason but also remember.

    Description:
    AI search is becoming the front door to information, whether through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Search-Augmented Generation (SAG), or custom agents that synthesize answers on top of indexed content. As users rely more heavily on these systems, evaluating their quality becomes mission-critical. But traditional metrics like precision and recall don’t capture the full picture.
    
    In this talk, we introduce a practical evaluation framework for AI-powered search, across three dimensions:
    - Are the retrieved sources relevant to the query?
    - And is the final answer complete?
    - Are the sources faithfully used in the generated answer?
    
    We’ll share lessons from working with search companies and present early findings from a new benchmark evaluating popular augmented AI systems across these dimensions. Rather than ranking winners and losers, we explore where different systems excel or break down, and how these tradeoffs inform product decisions.

    Description:
    Agents are all the rage in 2025, and every single b2b SaaS startup/incumbent promises AI agents that can "automate work" in some way.
    
    But how do you actually build this? The answer is two fold:
    1. really really good tools
    2. carefully tailored agent reasoning over these tools that range from assistant-to-automation based UXs.
    
    The main goal of this talk is to a practical overview of agent architectures that can automate real-world work, with a focus on document-centric tasks. Learn the core building blocks of best-in-class "tools" around processing, manipulating, and indexing/retrieving PDFs to Excel spreadsheets. Also learn the range of agent architectures suited for different tasks, from chat assistant-based UXs with high human-in-the-loop, to automation UXs that rely on encoding a business process into an end-to-end task solver. These architectures have to be generalizable but also highly accurate as agents get increasingly better at reasoning and code-writing.

    Session Title: Building a Smarter AI Agent with Neural RAG
    Description:
    RAG quality for AI agents is critical, and traditional keyword-based search engines consistently underperform in agentic or multi-step tasks, where semantic grounding and contextual nuance matter most.
    
    In this talk, Will Bryk, CEO of Exa will live code two AI agent applications–one using traditional keyword search RAG and one using neural network RAG via vector search. He’ll then evaluate both applications based on task performance, relevance, and latency. With a live demo (no theory or pre-baked applications), the audience will get a firsthand look at the practical differences between keyword and semantic systems in production, and learn embedding strategies, indexing trade-offs, hybrid retrieval techniques, prompt tuning, and more.

    Description:
    The adoption of AI into software development has been bumpy. While autocomplete tools like Copilot have gone mainstream, autonomous agents like Devin and OpenHands have generated both enthusiasm and skepticism. Some engineers claim they generate a 10x productivity boost; others that they just create noise and tech debt.
    
    The difference between the enthusiasts and the skeptics is that the enthusiasts have reasonable expectations for what these agents can do, and have both practical and intuitive knowledge for how to use them effectively.
    
    In this session, we'll talk about what tasks are appropriate for today's software agents, what tasks they might start to succeed at in 2025, and what tasks are best left to humans no matter how good they get.

    Session Title: How to trust an agent with software delivery
    Description:
    AI-powered agents promise faster, easier software delivery, but their unpredictable behavior often makes engineers hesitant to fully trust them with critical workflows. Sam Alba, Co-founder of Dagger (and previously co-creator of Docker), explains how teams can reliably integrate agents into their delivery pipelines by shifting how they structure and manage automation.
    
    He'll share four practical strategies learned from real-world experience:
    
    1. Treat agents as workflow participants, not isolated tools.
    Stop using agents as disconnected scripts or IDE plugins. Treating them as first-class parts of your delivery process simplifies your architecture, reduces hidden complexity, and makes agent outcomes more predictable.
    
    2. Use many small agents instead of one big one.
    Just as software evolved from monoliths to microservices, software delivery benefits from smaller, specialized agents with clearly defined responsibilities. Smaller agents are easier to understand, maintain, and integrate.
    
    3. Define clear environments—the real lever for reliability.
    Instead of chasing perfect prompts or models, focus on clearly defining the tools, resources, and permissions around your agents. Precisely controlling their environments makes agents behave consistently and reliably.
    
    4. Design workflows for easy debugging and observability.
    Agents will sometimes fail unexpectedly. Sam will share simple, effective ways to build clear tracing and observability into your workflows from the start, making debugging quicker and less frustrating.
    
    You'll leave with practical, immediately usable techniques that give you the confidence to trust AI agents in your software delivery pipelines.

    Description:
    Planning, coding, testing, monitoring—the endless cycle that spans 10+ tools that fragment our focus and slows delivery to a crawl. Vibe coding doesn't work when you've got 10TB of code. If you just sighed, you're one of many professional software engineers trapped in the traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC) that was designed before AI could parallelize your entire workflow.
    
    But what if you could orchestrate multiple AI agents on tasks beyond just generating code, while you focus on the creative decisions that matter?
    
    In this talk, I'll demonstrate how real enterprise organizations are changing their entire SDLC—going from understanding, planning, coding, and testing all the way to incident response—using AI agents. You'll witness the next evolution of software engineering—where AI doesn't just generate code, but orchestrates the entire development lifecycle.

    In this talk, we’ll explore how machine identity is evolving to meet this new landscape. You’ll learn:
    
    - How to think about authentication for agents (not just humans)
    - What it means to authorize an action when the actor is an LLM or headless service
    - Real-world strategies from WorkOS and Cloudflare for assigning, managing, and revoking agent identity and access

    Session Title: Securing Agents with Open Standards
    Description:
    Shipping AI agents that are safe for production means solving some tough identity and authorization challenges that are not always obvious at the prototype stage. In practice, this comes down to a handful of deeply technical questions:
    - How do you make sure agents are only acting for the right user?
    - How do you prevent over-broad API access or data leaks?
    - How do you handle user approvals when there is no UI, or you need a human in the loop?
    - And how do you avoid the usual pain points like manual credential sharing, stale keys, or unpredictable scopes without writing a lot of brittle, custom code?
    
    This talk digs into the real technical trade-offs behind building secure, user-aware AI agents. We will go beyond what to do and explain why, sharing the architectural decisions, open standards, and hard lessons learned from integrating OAuth, OIDC, RAR, and async authorization into agent-driven workflows.
    
    You will see a hands-on demo using an open-source Node.js agent and open protocols, with a focus on practical integration and no magic. The session will show how these solutions have shaped our approach to identity in GenAI and where we see the field heading next.
    
    If you are an engineer building AI apps that need real guardrails, not just a happy-path demo, we hope to leave you with some practical patterns, design rationale, and a clear view of the trade-offs for making your own agents production ready.

    Session Title: Fuzzing in the GenAI Era
    Description:
    "Evaluation" is one of those concepts that every AI practitioner vaguely knows is important, but few practitioners truly understand. Is "eval" the dataset for measuring the quality of your AI system? Is "eval" the measure, the metric of quality? Is "eval" the process of human annotation and scoring? Or is "eval" a third-party dataset run once to benchmark a model?
    
    To mitigate this cacophony, this talk will provide an opinionated and principled perspective for what we actually mean when we say “evaluation”, beyond the traditional for-loop-over-a-static dataset.
    
    In particular, this perspective draws heavy inspiration from *fuzzing*, i.e. bombarding AI with simulated, unexpected user inputs to uncover corner cases at scale. This factors into sub-problems regarding:
    
    - Quality Metric. What is the actual criteria we, as humans, are using to determine if an AI system is producing good or bad responses? How do we elicit these criteria before the human SME can articulate them? How do we, as efficiently as possible, operationalize this criteria with an automated *Judge*?
    
    - Stimuli Generation. Given a metric, how do we know, with confidence, that an AI system is performing well with respect to the metric? What data is representative and sufficient for discovering all potential bugs of an AI system? And how do we generate this complex, diverse, faithful data at scale?
    
    We will discuss in detail the philosophy, technology, and case studies behind both problems of Quality Metric and Stimuli Generation, and how they interact in concert.

    Description:
    Code is the lingua franca for both software engineers and highly capable AI models. As we give agents the ability to build, test, and run code that they generate, the command line becomes their canvas—and their attack surface.
    
    This keynote explores what it takes to bring code-executing agents from research to real-world deployment while maintaining control and security. We’ll cover how terminals offer AI an ideal interface, why they’re deceptively risky, and what it means to embed security, guardrails, and trust at every layer.
    
    It’s not just about what agents can do—it’s about what they should do, and how we make sure they do it safely.

    Session Title: Securing Agents with Open Standards
    Description:
    Shipping AI agents that are safe for production means solving some tough identity and authorization challenges that are not always obvious at the prototype stage. In practice, this comes down to a handful of deeply technical questions:
    - How do you make sure agents are only acting for the right user?
    - How do you prevent over-broad API access or data leaks?
    - How do you handle user approvals when there is no UI, or you need a human in the loop?
    - And how do you avoid the usual pain points like manual credential sharing, stale keys, or unpredictable scopes without writing a lot of brittle, custom code?
    
    This talk digs into the real technical trade-offs behind building secure, user-aware AI agents. We will go beyond what to do and explain why, sharing the architectural decisions, open standards, and hard lessons learned from integrating OAuth, OIDC, RAR, and async authorization into agent-driven workflows.

    In this talk, we will give a brief intro to OAuth.  Then we will talk about the state of authorization in MCP.  We will show how an MCP client uses OAuth to authenticate a user and securely access private resources and tools hosted by an MCP server.  Then we’ll look at ways autonomous agents can use OAuth on their own behalf, talking to other agents and MCP servers directly.  We’ll learn how to use OAuth to build agents that humans and machines can trust.

    Session Title: [Voice Keynote] Your realtime AI is ngmi
    Description:
    Sean DuBois of OpenAI and Pion, and Kwindla Hultman Kramer of Daily and Pipecat, will talk about why you have to design realtime AI systems from the network layer up.
    
    Most people who build realtime AI apps and frameworks get it wrong. They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.
    
    Sean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers "thick" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)

    Description:
    How do you get time to first byte (TTFB) below 150 milliseconds for voice models -- and scale it in production? As it turns out, open-source TTS models like Orpheus have an LLM backbone that lets us use familiar tools and optimizations like TensorRT-LLM and FP8 quantization to serve the models with low latency. But client code, network infrastructure, and other outside-the-GPU factors can introduce latency in the production stack. In this talk, we'll cover the basic mechanics of TTS inference, common pitfalls to avoid in integrating them into production systems, and how to extend this high-performance system to serve customized models with voice cloning and fine-tuning.

    Session Title: Why ChatGPT Keeps Interrupting You
    Description:
    ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode isn’t interrupting just you. Interruptions, and turn-taking in general, are unsolved problems for all Voice AI agents. Nobody likes being cut short – and people have much less patience for machines than they do for other humans. Turn-taking failures take many forms (e.g., the agent interrupts the user, the agent mistakes a cough for an interruption), and all of them lead to users immediately hanging up the phone.
    
    In this talk, we use human conversation as a framework for understanding both today’s approaches to turn detection and where the field is headed. You’ll learn about how linguists think about turn detection in human dialogue, what’s working (and what’s broken) in current methods, and how we might build Voice AIs that interrupt you less than your human brother.

    That’s the challenge we took on with Fin Voice at Intercom. Enterprise customer service demands high-quality, reliable voice interactions - but delivering that fast means wrestling with tough problems like latency, hallucinations, voice quality, and answer accuracy.
    
    We rapidly evaluated and integrated a full voice stack - including transcription, language model, text-to-speech, retrieval-augmented generation, and telephony - while designing tools that fit seamlessly into existing human support workflows.
    
    In this session, I’ll share key lessons from our accelerated development of Fin Voice. We'll explore the technical and operational hurdles we faced, the trade-offs we made, and how we built deployment and handover tools that work for customer service teams.
