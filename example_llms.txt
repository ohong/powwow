AI is no longer just a back-end tool—it’s shaping how we design our homes, connect in communities, and empower agents to take meaningful action. This panel brings together three founders at the forefront of this shift: Alyx van der Vorm (Clyx), building a new kind of social network centered on real-world connection; Patrick Murphy (Maket.ai), democratizing architecture with generative AI that produces zoning-compliant home designs in minutes; and Karan Vaidya (Composio), powering the next wave of AI agents with tools that enable real-world execution. Moderated by Jeremiah Owyang, General Partner at Blitzscaling Ventures and founder of the Llama Lounge event series, the session will explore how AI and agents are redefining the way we live and interact—and what it takes to build enduring companies that thrive beyond the hype.
