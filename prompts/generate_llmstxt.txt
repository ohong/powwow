## Input

## Process Instructions

### 1. Initial Website Exploration
- Start at the provided URL and thoroughly explore all pages and subpages
- Look for navigation menus, footer links, and any accessible conference-related pages
- Check for schedule pages, speaker directories, FAQ sections, venue information, and sponsor listings
- If there's a JSON endpoint for sessions/speakers (like /sessions-speakers-details.json), prioritize that for accurate data

### 2. Information Extraction

  - Format (Talk, Workshop, Keynote, Panel, etc.)
  - Room/location
  - Date and time
  - Session title
  - Full description

**Additional Information:**

```

### 4. Quality Guidelines

- **Completeness:** Include ALL sessions, speakers, and relevant information found on the website
- **Accuracy:** Double-check times, dates, names, and titles
- **Readability:** Use clear headers, consistent formatting, and logical organization
- **Plain Text:** Ensure the output is plaintext-friendly (no HTML, use markdown sparingly)
- **Line Length:** Keep lines reasonable for readability (around 80-100 characters where practical)
- **Hyperlinks:** Include important URLs in markdown format [text](url)

### 5. Special Considerations

- If information is behind a login or paywall, note what's inaccessible
- If the schedule is subject to change, include a note about checking the website for updates
- Include copyright information if present
- If there are multiple ticket types, list them with prices
- For virtual/hybrid events, note online participation options
- Extract any COVID/health protocols if mentioned

### 6. Output

Generate a single comprehensive llms.txt file that serves as a complete reference guide for the conference. The document should be self-contained - someone should be able to understand everything about the conference without visiting the website.

## Example Usage

Input: "https://www.ai.engineer/worldsfair/2025"
